# senior-project
## my senior project for high school, a neural network (hopefully by the end of this year) capable of identifying images and what is contained within them to at least 50-75% accuracy

### File Structure
* fn.py - storage for functions, classes, & other stuff like that
* main.py - initializer for the model itself and also a trainer, auto switches between the two when deemed necessary to do so (if there is previous save data)
* exhibition.py - used to show off the neural network with an external dataset
* storage.json - stores the network info
